                                <p><b>Formula One </b>(also known as <b>F1</b>) is the highest class of international racing for
                                    open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the FIA. The World
                                    Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981,
                                    has been one of the premier forms of racing worldwide since its inaugural season in
                                    1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
                                    participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                                    known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and
                                    closed public roads.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships:
                                    one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super
                                    Licence, the highest class of racing license issued by the FIA. The races must run
                                    on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade rating issued by the FIA.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    F1 cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to
                                    very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of
                                    aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings,
                                    which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. Major
                                    changes to the cars for the 2022 season have seen greater use of ground effect
                                    aerodynamics, and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the
                                    goal of making overtaking easier. With the average annual cost of running a team –
                                    designing, building and maintaining cars, pay and transport – is approximately
                                    US$265 million, its financial and political battles are widely reported.
