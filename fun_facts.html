                                        F1 racers lose over 3 litres of body water during 1 race
                                        <p>According to Telegraph, the average F1 is equipped with 1.5 liters of water
                                            in the car, which is hooked to the helmet. This, in most cases, isn't enough
                                            to keep the drivers hydrated for long enough. It thus takes a lot of
                                            endurance and physical fitness to be a Formula race car driver.

                                        Car tires lose 0.5kgs during a race
                                        <p>Formula 1 car tires lose 0.5 kgs during the race. This is because of the wear
                                            and tear that comes as a result of the high speed and the abrupt breaking.
                                            The G-Force doesn't spare the tires.

                                        The average F1 racer loses 4 kg during a race
                                        <p>Itâ€™s not just tires, but also racers who lose weight during an F1 race. The
                                            main reason why Formula 1 drivers lose up to 4 KGs is the unbearable
                                            temperatures in the cockpit, which can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius.

                                        The F1 Helmets are the toughest in the world
                                        <p>F1 helmets should be extremely light. This presents the challenge of coming
                                            up with a product that can also be as tough as it needs to be. To ensure
                                            that the helmets meet the strict requirements, they have to go through a
                                            couple of fragmentation and deformation tests. Carbon fiber is the main
                                            material that's used to make F1 helmets because of its robustness.

                                        Juan Fangio is the oldest racer to win an F1 title
                                        <p>The oldest driver to win a title was Juan Manuel Fangio (the elder), who
                                            collected the final of his five world titles in 1957 at the age of 47. The
                                            oldest race winner, Luigi Fagioli, who won the 1951 French Grand Prix for
                                            Alfa Romeo, aged 53 years and 22 days.

                                        Formula 1 cars have 25 buttons on the steering wheel
                                        <p>If you think your modern steering wheel is complicated, the Formula 1 drivers
                                            have it worse. Their steering wheels can have upwards of 25 buttons on them.
                                            Each button and switch controls every aspect of the car, allowing the driver
                                            ultimate control.

                                        F1 cars accelerate from 0 to 100 MPH and hit back to 0 within 4 seconds
                                        <p>Imagine accelerating to 100 mph and returning to zero in just 4 seconds. You
                                            might not survive if you have a heart condition. The effect is like feeling
                                            your body being squeezed with an invisible force. Breath control is
                                            essential in such a situation, and F1 drivers have to go through several
                                            drills to prepare for G-Force.
